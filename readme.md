# Can AI create Tetris with react?

only one bug with the T block when it rotates and one time the collision was a little off when turned this way -|   90% of the code was written by the AI.

I wrote some code to help with the UI and when the AI was not understanding the issues I took them into my own hands and then re-prompted the AI with the new code or asked it to rewrite code that becomes buggy after being rewritten

yes, it can if you take your time and tell it that its wrong enough times.... haha
